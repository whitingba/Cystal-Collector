# unit-4-game

Created a game that you collect crystals by clicking on the crystals to increase your score to match
the score reandomly generated by the game. 
Match the number of crystals to collect and you win the game. Exceed them and you lose. 

*There is currently an issue with the game in that once the game has ended and you keep clicking on the 
crystals the win or loss continues to add up. This will need to be debugged.*
